DigraphProperties.c is the code execute the graph functions. 

List.c is the implementation of List and Node structure.

List.h is the header of List and Node structure.

Digraph.c is the implementation of Graph structure.

Digraph.h is the header of Digraph structure.

Makefile is altered makefile code for DigraphProperties.

In my program, I use DFS to find the order of ending time in a directed graph and save the result in a List. 
Then I create a new directed graph as the reversed graph of the original directd graph.
As for SCCs, I use a List array to save them. I run DFS with the List order I got in the first DFS, result. Then I run seveal DFSs until all the elements in the result List is visited.
Each time the DFS ends, the index number add 1 to save the next SCC into another element of List array.
So the index shows GetCountSCC. 
In GetNumSCCVertices we can find the index of List array with a vertex. Then I return the length of that List.
In InSameSCC, I use the same method above to find two indexes and compare them.
