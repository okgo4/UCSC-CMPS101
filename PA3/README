DigraphProperties.c is the code execute the graph functions. 
List.c is the implementation of List and Node structure.
List.h is the header of List and Node structure.
Digraph.c is the implementation of Graph structure.
Digraph.h is the header of Digraph structure.
Makefile is altered makefile code for GraphProperties.

in distance()
I use BFS to find the distance between two vertices. I use a List as queue to append the Node into the List. After BFS, this function will output the least value of distance between two vertices.The complexity if O(m+n).

in acyclic()
I use for to go over all vertices and use BFS to check whether the vertices go back to themselves. So the complexity if O(m+n).


in topoSort()
Firstly I use acyclic to check whether the Digraph is acyclic or not. If not, I run DFS to go over all vertices and when I mark the vertices as all done. I prepend it to a List. After searching, I use printList to print the result. So the complexity if O(m+n).
