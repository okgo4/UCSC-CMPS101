Digraph newDigraph(int numVertices);

// that (u, v) is an edge in G. Returns -1 if v is not a legal vertex.

// If the edge does already exist, does nothing. Used when edges are entered or added.

// Returns 1 if (u, v) is a legal edge and the edge did already exist.
// Returns -1 if (u, v) is not a legal edge.

// Deletes v from the adjacency list of u, if that edge exists.
// If the edge doesnbt exist, does nothing. Used when edges are deleted.
// Returns 0 if (u, v) is a legal edge, and the edge did already exist.
// Returns 1 if (u, v) is a legal edge and the edge didnbt already exist.
// Returns -1 if (u, v) is not a legal edge.

/*** Other operations ***/
void printDigraph(FILE* out,Digraph G);
// Outputs the digraph G in the same format as an input line, including the number of vertices
// and the edges. The edges should be in sorted order, as described above.
void distance(FILE* out,Digraph G, int u, int v);
// Outputs the distance between vertices u and v if there is a directed path between them in the
// digraph. Otherwise, outputs INF
void acyclic(FILE* out,Digraph G);
// Outputs YES if the digraph is acyclic. Otherwise, outputs NO.
void topoSort(FILE* out,Digraph G);
// Outputs a topological sort of the digraph. If the digraph is not acyclic, outputs IMPOSSIBLE.
